## Inspiration
We were inspired by the prize - the 300 bucks.


## What it does
The main point of this website is that it teaches people about common mental disorders, as well as having a fun activity where you can see which symptoms are the result of certain disorders and also having a quiz where you can quiz yourself on the disorders.

## How we built it
We used HTML for basically everything, and the aesthetics were all made using CSS. We built it on the platform Replit.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge was trying to be creative. We found generating ideas a big wall and also found it to be very time-consuming. However, we are sort of proud of our result and hope that no one else has done any better. For example, one of the challenges Mark ran into was making and designing the 2x8 information grid. It was pretty complex with all the features he put into it. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re very proud of how we’re able to make our website a reality, as well as making it look kind of aesthetically pleasing. At first, we made a boring white website, but we soon added more and more things that made it look awesome.

## What we learned
Hosun: I mostly learned how to use HTML a lot more, as I barely used it in the past. I also learned a lot about the disorders themselves, such as how OCD can actually really interfere with day to day activities.

Mark: I dove deeper into HTML and CSS, and learned how to make websites look a lot better with CSS. I relearned a ton of things that I forgot how to do from before, and freshened my memory up. I also learned how if you suck, some errors take hours to solve and CSS is annoying as hell. Furthermore, I also learned about the many disorders and how hackathons are mentally tiring for your brain.

## What's next for Diagnosing Disorders Website
In the future, we may be thinking of adding a game to the Diagnosing Disorders Website. The only reason we didn’t add one was because the time was a little too tight, and we spent too much time on the aesthetics.
